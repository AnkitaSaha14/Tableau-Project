# Tableau-Project : Maven Pizza Challenge
Here's a challenge provided by Maven Analytics for setting up a data model and leveraging data analysis & visualization skills to bring the data underneath to life. 

About dataset: The challenge dataset contains a year's worth of sales from a fictitious pizza place. 
The dataset contains 4 tables in CSV format
The Orders table contains the date & time that all table orders placed
The Order Details table contains the different pizzas served with each order in the Orders table, and their quantities
The Pizzas table contains the size and price for each distinct pizza in the Order Details table, as well as its broader pizza type
The Pizza Types table contains details on the pizza types in the Pizzas table, including their name as it appears on the menu, the category it falls under, and its list of ingredients

Description about the challenge :
Things are going OK at Plato's, but there's room for improvement. Here's a collection of the transactional data for the past year, but haven't been able to put it to good use. Sharing an analysis of the data put together with a report to help Plato's find opportunities to drive more sales and work more efficiently.

Steps followed:
1)Downloaded the dataset from maven's data playground
2)Imported the dataset file(csv file) in Tableau Desktop 
3) Data cleaning: Used data interpretor to clean the data files
4) Because there are 4 csv files, each related to each other, I tried creating a relationship among all the files: ![data relation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128919598/230059195-077d28cd-654a-4225-9593-199dad5e49ff.jpeg)
